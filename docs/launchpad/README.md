# Launchpad

Version 7.0 of the **Relationship Visualizer** introduced the `Lauchpad` ribbon tab to consolidate all the buttons used to show/hide worksheets which were scattered across various ribbon tabs. 

This new tab provides an easy way to control which worksheets are displayed, which can help you focus on a small set of worksheets, or hide the worksheets which you never use.

## The `Launchpad` Ribbon Tab

The `Launchpad` ribbon tab is always present, and is located as the first **Relationship Visualizer** tab after Excel's `Help` tab. The characters `||` in the ribbon are intended to help identify where Excel's set of tabs end, and where the Relationship Visualizer tabs begin.

The `Launchpad` tab appears as follows on Microsoft Windows:

- [Graphviz dot](./README.md#graphviz-dot)

Six language translations are provided. The tool is authored in English in the US. The English translations are then translated to the other languages using the [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/).

### Locale

| ![](./launchpad-ribbon-locale.png) |
| ------- |

Provides an easy-to-find setting which controls which language is displayed in ribbon tabs and worksheet headings. 

| Label | Control Type  | Description |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Set Language  | Dropdown List       | Establishes the language translation to use in ribbon tabs and worksheet headings. Changing the language has immediate effect, and you do not need to close and reopen the workbook.|
| Verbose Labels  | Checkbox        | Ribbons on MacOS do not show the groups which exist in the ribbon tabs on Windows OS. Verbose labels adding the group to the label were created to compensate, so things like 'Color' can be differentiated as 'Font Color' vs. 'Fill Color'. <br/><br/>By default, verbose labels are displayed on macOS, and short lables on Windows OS. The user is free to choose which style of labels to display.  |
| Metric Units  | Checkbox       | Graphviz uses the imperial units "inches" for measurements. Metric units were introduced into the Relationship Visualizer as display units in version 7.0, with appropriate conversion to imperial units behind the scenes performed. Checking this box switches the display from inches to millimeters.  |
