Excel to Graphviz Relationship Visualizer
-----------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

The Relationship Visualizer lets you easily collect relationship information in Excel and quickly create relationship graphs.

It automatically draws relationship diagrams from high-level instructions, handling details like shape placement and connecting lines. While it offers many customization options, itâ€™s not designed for precise, pixel-perfect control. If you need exact placement or like to draw freehand, this tool might not be suitable for you.

This tool is perfect for those who want quick visualizations with minimal effort and aren't concerned with detailed placement. Just provide simple 'A is related to B' statements, and the Relationship Visualizer will generate a comprehensive graphical depiction of the data.


INSTALLATION

The documentation at https://exceltographviz.com/install/ provides all the information you need to set up and use the Relationship Visualizer.

Please note that the co-requisite Open Source Graphviz tools are not included in this package. The online documentation provides detailed instructions on how to obtain and install them separately.


GETTING STARTED

Take the time to carefully follow the guides at https://exceltographviz.com/ and master the tool for the best results. Much of the graphic processing complexity is pre-configured and hidden, so creating a graph can be as easy as entering lists and pressing a button. However, exploring the full capabilities allows you to craft intricate and impressive graphs. Once you get the hang of it, the process becomes straightforward, enjoyable, and rewarding!
