# Excel to Graphviz

The [Relationship Visualizer](https://exceltographviz.com/) is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that uses [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) to generate graph diagrams from Excel data. 

![](./docs/overview/styles_applied.png)

In addition to its core graphing capabilities, the *Relationship Visualizer* spreadsheet includes tools for visually combining Graphviz style attributes and saving them to a stylesheet, executing [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) queries, displaying the [Graphviz DOT Language](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) source code generated by the tool, displaying console messages from Graphviz's `dot` program, and adding animation code to published [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) graphs. 

The *Relationship Visualizer* is compatible with both **Microsoft Windows** and **Apple macOS** operating systems and operates through an intuitive [tabbed ribbon interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_(computing)) for seamless navigation and functionality.

Languages supported in the ribbon interface include English (US, UK), French, German, Italian, and Polish.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the *Relationship Visualizer* Microsoft Excel workbook, its source files, documentation, and distribution package. The workbook is packaged as a ZIP file for distribution on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/relationship-visualizer/). Source files extracted for version control and legacy documentation preserved in its original formats are provided by this GitHub repository.

## Source Code

Since the *Relationship Visualizer* is a [Visual Basics for Applications (VBA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications) macro-enabled workbook, its VBA code is embedded directly within the Excel file. This code can be accessed and managed through the Visual Basic Editor, available under the `Developer` tab. To facilitate easier review and version control, the embedded VBA content has been exported, organized, and placed in the [`src`](./src/) directory of this repository, allowing for efficient tracking of changes and collaboration.

All development is conducted within the Visual Basic Editor, as a round-trip DevOps workflow between GitHub and the Excel workbook is not feasible. The exported code is shared as a courtesy for those interested in exploring and understanding the mechanics of the spreadsheet.

## Distribution Files

Currently, there is no integration established between GitHub and SourceForge. Distribution files are gathered and maintained within the `dist/Relationship Visualizer` folder. These files are then packaged into the `Relationship Visualizer.zip` file and manually uploaded to SourceForge with each new release.
